SETTING:
Thunderstorm in the background.

Macbeth
Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day, To the last syllable of recorded time; And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death. 
Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow.

Lady Macbeth
Out, damned spot! out, I say! - One: two: why, then, 'tis time to do't. - Hell is murky! - Fie, my lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account?
